# About <a name = "about"></a>
This project focuses on the development of a Discord bot (automated user) written in TypeScript, enabling users to play music from various platforms such as YouTube and Spotify with a single command. Users also have the option to create their own playlist to save
music, which is automatically uploaded to a MongoDB database. Users can further save
their favorite music to this database using a button embedded in a message containing information about the currently playing music. Modern technologies and the TypeScript programming language were used in the development, with particular emphasis on integrating
Lavalink for optimized music playback.
